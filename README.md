# Real-time-LSTM
Using the DROPBEAR dataset and NI hardware, predicting state (pin location) of a system. Offline training done with `tensorflow.keras`, I pass the weights to LabVIEW using .csv files and LabVIEW scripting.

Don't expect to run files straight from download. DROPBEAR dataset not included and LabVIEW files have dependancies all over the place.
