# Real-time-LSTM
Using the DROPBEAR dataset and NI hardware, predicting state (pin location) of a system. Offline training done with `tensorflow.keras`, I pass the weights to LabVIEW using .csv files and LabVIEW scripting.

[/python training environment](https://github.com/ARTS-Laboratory/Real-time-LSTM/tree/main/python%20training%20environment) contains the dataset and all scripts and should be able to run from download. LabVIEW implementation can be done with the [LabVIEW LSTM library](https://github.com/ARTS-Laboratory/LabVIEW-LSTM).
